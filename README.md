# üöÄ AfriCred - Earn-to-Learn Platform

> **Where AI meets Education meets Blockchain**

## üéØ Project Overview

AfriCred is an "Earn-to-Learn" platform built on EduChain, designed for African students and educators. The platform combines gamification, blockchain technology, and AI to create an educational ecosystem where students can earn rewards while learning.

**Note: This is a demo application showcasing the platform's capabilities. Supabase integration will be implemented in future versions for full backend functionality. Currently deployed on Vercel.**

## üí∞ EDU Token & Reward System

- **Token Name**: EDU Token
- **Network**: EduChain Testnet (Chain ID: 656476)
- **Purpose**: Educational rewards and platform governance
- **Current Status**: Demo/Testnet tokens (no real monetary value)

### üèÜ **Reward System Design**
The platform implements a comprehensive reward system where students earn EDU tokens through various educational activities:

#### **Lesson Completion Rewards**
- **Easy Lessons**: 25-50 EDU tokens
- **Medium Lessons**: 50-100 EDU tokens  
- **Hard Lessons**: 100-200 EDU tokens
- **Bonus Rewards**: Additional tokens for perfect scores and fast completion

#### **Achievement System**
- **First Lesson**: 25 EDU bonus
- **Streak Bonuses**: 10-50 EDU for consecutive completions
- **Special Achievements**: 100-500 EDU for milestone accomplishments
- **Community Contributions**: 25-100 EDU for helping other students

#### **Educator Rewards**
- **Content Creation**: 100-500 EDU per approved lesson
- **Student Engagement**: 10-25 EDU per student completion
- **Quality Bonuses**: 200-1000 EDU for highly-rated content

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice: Demo Values**
**All EDU token amounts shown in this demo are representative and have no real monetary value. These are demonstration values to showcase the platform's reward mechanics and user experience.**

### üîÑ **Points-to-EDU Conversion System**
The platform features a dual-token system for enhanced user experience:

#### **Learning Points (LP)**

- **Purpose**: Immediate feedback and progress tracking
- **Features**: 
  - Instant earning and display
  - No blockchain transaction fees
  - Real-time updates

#### **EDU Token Distribution**
- **Conversion Process**: LP automatically convert to EDU tokens
- **Batch Processing**: Daily/weekly conversion to minimize gas fees
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Automated token distribution
- **Transparency**: All conversions visible on blockchain explorer

### üéÆ **Gamification Elements**
